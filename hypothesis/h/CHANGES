  WebSocket.

0.7.1 (2015-08-13)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

- Clicking on annotation cards and the navigational bucket indicators should
  work once more in the PDF.js viewer.

- Fixed an issue with timezone localization that caused unnecessary errors to
  be thrown and caught. Auditing this resulted in a removal of some significant
  bloat from unnecessary code.

Features
--------

- When sorting annotations by document location the TextPositionSelector
  information is now used instead of highlight position information. This
  causes less shuffling and re-rendering on load and when lazy-rendered pages
  in the PDF.js viewer appear and disappear at the cost of seeing annotations
  that have changed position or that target content within fixed position
  containers sometimes appear to be out of order.

- Removed an unnecessary call, originating in the infinite scrolling code, from
  the sidebar widget.

0.7.0 (2015-08-10)

  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2435

  cards. The view now scrolls so that the annotation is one fifth of the way
  down the screen, allowing room for navigation bars but leaving the annotation
  near the top of the screen.

- Support for the PDF.js viewer shipping in Firefox 40.

- Add a NIPSA service worker definition.

  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2381

- Fix an issue where failed document equivalence searches resulted in
  annotations on http://example.com/ being returned.
  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2334

- Avoid some problems caused by annotating the application itself, such as
  by annotating the stream page.

- User experience and usability improvements.
  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2330
  https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2352 and
  https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2349
