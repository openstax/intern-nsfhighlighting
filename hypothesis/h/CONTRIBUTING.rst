Contributing to Hypothesis
==========================

Thank you for your interest! We love contributions from other people, so please
feel free to fix bugs, make improvements, update documentation, or do anything
else that you think will help.

We ask only that you follow a few simple guidelines for contributing:

1. Be courteous and respectful of others. Read our `communication guidelines
   <https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community.html>`_.

2. If you find a bug, please report it in `a GitHub issue
   <https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues>`_, but do check first that no-one
   else has already reported the same problem. Please try and give us enough
   detail to reproduce your issue. If you're not sure what that means, `here's a
   guide on how to report bugs effectively
   <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>`_.

   **Please do not submit feature requests or support queries as GitHub
   issues**: send those `to our mailing list
   <https://groups.google.com/a/list.hypothes.is/forum/#!forum/dev>`_ where the
   community can discuss them!

3. If you have ideas on new features or changes to the codebase that go beyond
   bug fixes, please `write to the community developer mailing list
   <https://groups.google.com/a/list.hypothes.is/forum/#!forum/dev>`_ **before
   you start work**. That way we'll avoid duplicating effort, and you will
   maximise the chances that your work is integrated quickly and painlessly.

4. If you haven't already done so (and you're submitting substantial changes to
   the code or documentation), please ensure you sign our `Contributor License
   Agreement <https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/cla.html>`_.
