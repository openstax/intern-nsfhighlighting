// Helpers for changing element style or behavior depending on whether scripting
// support is available and successfully loaded

/**
 * Mixin which enables styles if the user agent is JavaScript-capable and
 * scripts are either loading or successfully loaded.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   @include js {
 *     // If JS is enabled, hide `thing` until the user performs some action
 *     // which sets the 'is-expanded' state on the element.
 *     //
 *     // If JS is not enabled or failed to load, this selector will not apply
 *     // and the element will not be hidden in the first place.
 *     .thing:not(.is-expanded) { display: none };
 *   }
